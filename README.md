## Title
### Small Images Dataset Classification using Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
In this project, I have implemented ANN for the CIFAR-10 dataset which is imported from keras library.
I have classified the images which will go through the softmax function to obtain the final prediction.
### Technologies used for the projec
Python, Numpy, Matplotlib, Keras, TensorFlow
### Description of the project
* This project is done as a part of the assigniments for Data Science and Machine Learning course at Integrify.
